In the vast digital playground of YouTube, distraction is just a click away. While the platform offers a treasure trove of educational content, the features that make it engaging also challenge focused study. This article explores the problem of distraction on YouTube and presents a concept for a new feature aimed at making the platform a more effective tool for learning.

### The Problem  
Picture this: You embark on a study session, seeking a tutorial to bolster your understanding. Yet, amidst the sea of recommendations, your attention veers off course. Before you know it, you’re entranced by unrelated content, and your scholarly endeavors are abruptly halted.

**The core issue is twofold:**
- Difficulty controlling usage due to highly engaging recommendations.
- Ease of getting distracted by non-academic videos.

### Understanding Distraction: Insights from User Research  
Through extensive user research, I uncovered that YouTube’s algorithm excels at serving engaging content, often unrelated to academic pursuits. This highlights the need for tools that help users maintain focus during study sessions.

### Brainstorming Solutions  
Working with peers, I brainstormed solutions, evaluating them for feasibility and user impact:
- **Study Profiles:** Personalized pages for academic use with customizable settings.
- **Study Mode:** A distraction-free mode blocking non-academic content.
- **Annotated Playlists:** Adding personal notes to videos for better organization.

After analysis, **Study Mode** emerged as the most promising solution.

### Designing the Study Mode  
**Study Mode** offers a distraction-free YouTube experience with:
- **Content Filtering Mechanism:** Differentiates between academic and non-academic content.
- **Study Mode Toggle:** Easily activates distraction-free mode.
- **Customizable Settings:** Personalizes the learning experience.

### Implementation and Testing  
Medium-fidelity prototypes were created and tested with users to refine the design. The final iteration focused on **Study Mode’s** core functionality—enhancing user engagement and learning efficiency.

### Conclusion: A Step Toward Focused Learning  
By implementing **Study Mode**, YouTube could evolve into a powerful educational tool, transforming from a source of distraction into a focused learning aid.
